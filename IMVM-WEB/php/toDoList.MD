Change the 'sanitizeInputsAndCheckEmpty' in 'IMVM-WEB\php\databaseFunctions.php' so it can either check arrays or single values (i just had to send a whole array with one value to check it .-.)

Re-do the 'IMVM-WEB\php\createTicketConfirm.php' so it sanitizes everything

Sanitize basically every input with the new function (pls first change it so it can validate single variables too)
