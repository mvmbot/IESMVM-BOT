1. Currently, we handle each case in our switch statement with (not done yet but was the idea) individual insert statements to their respective tables. However, this approach might be inefficient due to the high number of cases.

2. I propose creating a generic function that takes the necessary values as parameters for database insertion. This would streamline our code and eliminate the need to manually repeat insert statements for each case. Additionally, I am considering integrating the 'areFieldsEmpty' function into this new function to minimize the number of function calls in each case. Further discussion is needed to finalize this decision.

3. I plan to explore alternative methods to optimize our code further. Researching and comparing various approaches will help us identify the most suitable solution for our project.

4. Another optimization idea is to create a function that simultaneously retrieves data from the form and validates it. This could potentially improve the speed of our code execution.

5. To ensure we make the right decision, I strongly suggest consulting Albert this file. He could provide valuable insights and help us understand the best option for our specific requirements.
